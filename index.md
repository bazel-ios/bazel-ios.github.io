# Bazel-iOS

The place where developers from top apps collaborate to build a fast and
relaible open source iOS build system tailored for our scale. 

### Impact

>  Bazel reduced build times by up to 4x in some cases. Bazel's build language,
>  robust open source core, and extensibility model gives us full control over
>  the entire system including the build graph and execution. -

### Getting started

The `rules_ios` mono-repo includes easy-to-use compiling and linking primitives
or rules, comprehensive Xcode integration and project generation, and a number
of other features. We've built a easy-to-use and performant system with
open-source-first principals and supporting a collaborative environment.

### Getting involved

Our first annual conference took place September 29th, 2022.

### Roadmap

team [coming soon](https://github.com/bazel-ios/rules_ios/issues).
